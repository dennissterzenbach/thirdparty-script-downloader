## thirdparty-script-downloader

This is a simple yet powerful helper script to manage a registry of libraries and their respective environment/system contexts with url and local filenames.

It allows you to download a new version of a thirdparty resource from its origin easily without having to remember the urls. 
The script maintains the registry, you can add as many resources and environments as you like. 

Each resource registration consists of a url and a local filename to store the content downloaded from that url to upon update.

See the commandline output for more info:
```
node downloadThirdpartyLib.js --help
```
