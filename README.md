## thirdparty-script-downloader

This is a simple yet powerful helper script to manage a registry of libraries and their respective environment/system contexts with url and local filenames to download a new version of a thirdparty library from its origin easily without having to remember the urls. The script maintains the registry, you can add as many ressources and environments as you like. Each consists of a url and a local filename to store the content downloaded from that url to upon update.

See the commandline output for more info:
```
node downloadThirdpartyLib.js --help
```
